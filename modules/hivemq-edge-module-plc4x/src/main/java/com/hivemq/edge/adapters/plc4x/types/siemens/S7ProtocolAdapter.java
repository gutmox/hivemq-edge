However some devices seem to have problems with this and hang up or cause other problems. In such a case, providing the controller-type will skip the identification process and hereby avoid this type of problem.

During the connection process both parties will negotiate a maximum size both parties can work with and is equal or smaller than the given value is used. The driver will automatically split up large requests to not exceed this value in a request or expected response. Default value: 1024 bytes

This parameter also will be negotiated during the connection process and the maximum both parties can work with and is equal or smaller than the given value is used. The driver will automatically take care not exceeding this value while processing requests. Too many requests can cause a growing queue. Default value: 8

This option is available for completeness and is correctly handled out during the connection process, however it is currently not enforced on PLC4Xâ€™s side. So if a PLC would send more messages than agreed upon, these would still be processed. Default value: 8

As there is no traffic, it must be assumed that the connection with the interlocutor was lost and it must be restarted. When the channel is closed, the "fail over" is carried out in case of having the secondary channel, or it is expected that it will be restored automatically, which is done every 4 seconds. Default value: 8 seconds.
